# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Running Locally

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

If port 9002 is already in use, you can try a different port using the command `npm run dev -- -p <PORT>`, replacing `<PORT>` with the desired port number.
